# 9. dbt Semantic Layer
## About the dbt Semantic Layer
The dbt Semantic Layer eliminates duplicate coding, by allowing data teams to define metrics on top of existing models and automatically handles data joins.

## Get started with the dbt Semantic Layer
MetricFlow allows you to define metrics in your dbt project, and query them whether in dbt Cloud, or dbt Core, with MetricFlow commands.

To query those metrics in downstream tools, you'll need a dbt Cloud Team or Enterprise account.

Semantic models consist of entities (all sorts of keys), dimensions, and measures.

It's best practice to create semantic models in the "/models/semantic_models" directory in your project. 

You can define metrics in the same YAML files as your semantic models, or create a new file. If you want to create your metrics in a new file, create another directory called "/models/metrics".
