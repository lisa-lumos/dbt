## Explore dbt projects
With dbt Explorer, you can view your project's resources (such as models, tests, and metrics) and their lineage to gain a better understanding of its latest production state.

dbt Explorer automatically retrieves the metadata updates after each job run in the production deployment environment so it always has the latest results for your project.
