### About dbt Core versions
dbt Labs provides different support levels for different versions, which may include new features, bug fixes, or security patches:
- Active. Will patch regressions, new bugs; fixes for older bugs, quality-of-life improvements.
- Critical. Newer minor versions, transition the previous minor version into "Critical Support" with limited "security" releases for critical security and installation fixes.
- End of Life. Minor versions that have reached EOL, no longer receive new patch releases.
- Deprecated. dbt Core versions older than v1.0 are no longer maintained by dbt Labs, nor supported in dbt Cloud.

Users should upgrade to patches, as soon as they're available.
